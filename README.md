# Video-Compilation
Strengthening my HTML skills. Made a collection of videos and utilizing multiple techniques together.

Final Update:
I am currently doing a full stack development course and I am doing these projects based off of some prompts that are given to me. 

WHat I did well:
    I am getting the hang of having a solid foundation to build the html on.
    Its easier for me to understand the elements and attributes and what they do
    as I always like to take good notes while learning

What I can improve:
    In this project, the videos were not rendering even though they were embedded properyly. I plan on doing further research to figure out exactly why and what I could do to make that work. Also my formatting may not be the best right now but im sure theres an extension to help with that.
